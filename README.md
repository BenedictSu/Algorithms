1. Factorials
Completed: 7 July 2018 16.06h
Duration: 1 hour
Language: java
To run the code, run Algorithms/1.Factorials/execute.bat (you will need to have java available)
It will execute the algorithm using Algorithms/1.Factorials/input.txt and compare the generated output.txt against Algorithms/1.Factorials/expected.txt
Add more inputs by appending the integers (spaces/newline separated) to the end of Algorithms/1.Factorials/input.txt, and append the respective expected results (spaces/newline separated) to the end of Algorithms/1.Factorials/expected.txt
