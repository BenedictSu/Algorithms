# Algorithms

Start: 7 July 2018 14.31h

1. Factorials
Completed: 7 July 2018 16.06h
Duration: 1 hour
Language: java
To run the code, run Algorithms/1.Factorials/execute.bat (you will need to have java available)
It will execute the algorithm using Algorithms/1.Factorials/input.txt and compare the generated output.txt against Algorithms/1.Factorials/expected.txt
Add more inputs by appending the integers (spaces/newline separated) to the end of Algorithms/1.Factorials/input.txt, and append the respective expected results (newline separated) to the end of Algorithms/1.Factorials/expected.txt

2. Sorting
Completed: 8 July 2018 00.10h
Duration: 5 hours (excluding 3.5 hours break)
Language: c++
To run the code, execute Algorithms/2.Sorting/execute.sh (you will need to have g++ available)
It will execute the algorithm using Algorithms/2.Sorting/input.txt and compare the generated output.txt against Algorithms/2.Sorting/expected.txt
Add more inputs by appending them (spaces/newline separated) to the end of Algorithms/2.Sorting/input.txt, and append the respective expected results (newline separated between answers) to the end of Algorithms/2.Sorting/expected.txt

3. Matrix Rotation
Completed: 8 July 2018 03.21h
Duration: 3 hours
Language: c++
To run the code, execute Algorithms/3.MatrixRotation/execute.sh (you will need to have g++ available)
It will execute the algorithm using Algorithms/3.MatrixRotation/input.txt and compare the generated output.txt against Algorithms/3.MatrixRotation/expected.txt
Add more inputs by appending them (spaces/newline separated) to the end of Algorithms/3.MatrixRotation/input.txt, and append the respective expected results (newline separated between answers) to the end of Algorithms/3.MatrixRotation/expected.txt
